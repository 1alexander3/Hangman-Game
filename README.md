# Hangman-Game
A game of hangman with some helpful hints
The program will generate a random word from the wordlist for the user to guess. 

Incorrectly guessing a letter will lose a guess, incorrectly guessing a vowel will lose 2 guesses. Imputing a '*' while provide a list of words that might be the correct word, but it is recommended that the user is close to figuring out the word (having most of the letters guessed correctly) before using the '*' symbol. Doing so with fewer correctly guessed words causes the list to generate a longer list of words.
